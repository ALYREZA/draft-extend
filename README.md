## Overview
Draft Extend is a platform to build a full-featured Draft.js editor using modular plugins that can integrate with [draft-convert](#) to serialize with HTML. The higher-order function API makes it extremely easy to use any number of plugins for rendering and conversion.

#### Usage:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {EditorState} from 'draft-js';
import {Editor, compose} from 'draft-extend';
import {convertFromHTML, convertToHTML} from 'draft-convert';

const plugins = compose(
    FirstPlugin,
    SecondPlugin,
    ThirdPlugin
);

const EditorWithPlugins = plugins(Editor); // Rich text editor component with plugin functionality
const toHTML = plugins(convertFromHTML); // function to convert from HTML including plugin functionality
const fromHTML = plugins(convertToHTML); // function to convert to HTML including plugin functionality

const MyEditor = React.createClass({
    getInitialState() {
        return {
            editorState: EditorState.createWithContent(fromHTML('<div></div>'))
        };
    },

    onChange(editorState) {
        const html = toHTML(editorState.getCurrentContent());
        console.log(html); // don't actually convert to HTML on every change!
        this.setState({editorState});
    },

    render() {
        return (
            <EditorWithPlugins
                editorState={this.state.editorState}
                onChange={this.onChange}
            />
        );
    }
});

ReactDOM.render(
    <MyEditor />,
    document.querySelector('.app')
);
```

## Examples

Examples of how to build plugins of different types are included in the [example](example/) directory. To run the examples locally:

1. run `npm install` in the `draft-extend` directory
2. open any HTML file in the `examples` directory in your web browser - no local server is necessary

## Editor
**Editor component on which to extend functionality with plugins created by [`createPlugin`](#createplugin).**

#### Props
The most important two props are:
- `editorState` - Draft.js `EditorState` instance to be rendered.
- `onChange: function(editorState: EditorState): void` - Like with vanilla Draft.js, function called on any editor change passing the `EditorState`.

Other props are used by plugins composed around `Editor`. See [Building Plugins](building-plugins.md) for more information. **These should generally not be used outside of the context of a plugin**:
- `buttons`: `Array<Component>` Array of React components to add to the controls of the editor.
- `overlays`: `Array<Component>` Array of React components to add as overlays to the editor.
- `decorators`: `Array<DraftDecorator>` Array of Draft.js decorator objects used to render the EditorState. They are added to the EditorState as a CompositeDecorator within the component and are of shape `{strategy, component}`.
- `styleMap`: `Object` Object map from Draft.js inline style type to style object. Used for the Draft.js Editor's `customStyleMap` prop.

All other props are passed down to the [Draft.js `Editor` component](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/docs/api-reference-editor.html) and to any buttons and overlays added by plugins.

***

## compose
Since the API of plugins is based around composition, a basic `compose` function is provided to make it easy to apply plugins to the component as well as conversion functions and provides a single source of truth for plugin configuration.
```javascript
// without compose
const EditorWithPlugins = FirstPlugin(SecondPlugin(ThirdPlugin(Editor)));
const fromHTML = FirstPlugin(SecondPlugin(ThirdPlugin(convertFromHTML)));
const toHTML = FirstPlugin(SecondPlugin(ThirdPlugin(convertToHTML)));

// with compose
const plugins = compose(
    FirstPlugin,
    SecondPlugin,
    ThirdPlugin
);

const EditorWithPlugins = plugins(Editor);
const toHTML = plugins(convertToHTML);
const fromHTML = plugins(convertFromHTML);
```
